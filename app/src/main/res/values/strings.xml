    <string name="start_massage_2">After clicking on the name of the quest, you go to the stage of passing, which consists of 2 parts (easy questions and difficult ones). Initially, you go through easy questions, which can earn a maximum of 83.3% (2 stars), if you score 2 stars - for the next passage of the quest, you will answer difficult questions with which you can score 83.3 - 100% (2-3 stars)</string>

Below there are 3 numbers that show: number of easy questions / difficult / number of attempts to pass. Above the stars there are two indications: the left one is the average percentage for all attempts, the right one is best result. The stars show the best result. Date - this is the date the quest was created, the name of the best result is displayed above the date, if it was specified.</string>
    <string name="start_massage_5">When you try to create your own question, you will be prevented by a dialog box in which you must specify the name of the quest, then you indicate the question itself, the answer to it, the difficulty and the next button, and fill in the next question, etc. until you get bored, then press end.

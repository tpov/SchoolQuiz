After clicking on the name of the quest, you go to the stage of passing, which consists of 2 parts (easy questions and difficult ones). Initially, you go through easy questions, which can earn a maximum of 83.3% (2 stars), if you score 2 stars – for the next passage of the quest, you will answer difficult questions with which you can score 83.3 – 100% (2–3 stars)

Quests can also be deleted - by clicking on the trash can, with a pop-up window with confirmation, as well as the ability not to delete the questions themselves from the database (We recommend checking the box - delete all questions)
    
You can also share quests, with or without answers, depending on whether you check the box, difficult questions will be marked with a *. (Basic questions do not show answers if you share them)
    
Near the button with the name of the quest there is an indicator that indicates the difficulty of the questions after pressing it, it can have 2 states, lite question / hard question. Below there are 3 numbers that show: number of easy questions / difficult / number of attempts to pass. Above the stars there are two indications: the left one is the average percentage for all attempts, the right one is best result. The stars show the best result. Date - this is the date the quest was created, the name of the best result is displayed above the date, if it was specified.
    
# New quiz
When you try to create your own question, you will be prevented by a dialog box in which you must specify the name of the quest, then you indicate the question itself, the answer to it, the difficulty and the next button, and fill in the next question, etc. until you get bored, then press end. Note that end also writes a question.
    
# Timer
Has a complex logic, if an answered question is displayed when the application starts - the timer does not start, if you rewind questions and an unanswered question opens - the timer starts, with further rewinding of questions - the timer continues to count even if you are on an answered question,
until you answer any of the questions or the timer runs out. If the timer runs out - it answers the current question randomly, if you are on an answered question - it answers the last viewed unanswered question.

In general, the timer starts if you read an unanswered question.
